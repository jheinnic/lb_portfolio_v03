###*
# RepositoryDomainPackage contains a domain model abstraction providing repository services for the models registered
# through the DocumentModelPackage data model's DocumentKind enumeration and AbstractDocument extension class.
#
# To develop new repository-based functionality, a modeler will typically create two extension pacakges, one for
# DocumentModelPackage, and one for RepositoryDomainPackage.
# ** The data model is defined by subclassing DocumentModelPackage.AbstractDocument and binding that subclass to a
#    new value of the DocumentModelPackage.DocumentKind enumeration.
# ** Access to repository services for CRUD and Synchronization services for that model are acquired through
#    the RepositoryDomain using a different pair of types.  AbstractCanvas is the extension class, and CanvasKind
#    is its enumeration.
#
# DocumentModelPackage introduces the "Document" and "ModelObject" abstractions.  It provides a facility for
# creating cross-document model re-use dependencies and provides metadata support for enabling controlled change
# reconciliation and state markers (e.g. stale dependencies and constraint violations).  Although it provides an
# interface for interacting with these bookkeeping elements, it defers conventions about how to reuse that inteface
# to a DomainModeling layer.  It focuses on the semantics of what dependecies and markers are, leaves how they
# apply to a modeled Document within each Document's extension contract.
#
# This is an intentional design decision.  It allows a Document to have a representation in multiple Domains.
# RepositoryDomainPackage is the only such domain at present, and it is oriented towards a client browser environment.
# What is done with composition here has a compatible analog in Loopback through the Local and Remote Model mixing
# classes.  Keep this in mind to stay prepared for a future Loopback migration path.  Let any semantics added
# to AbstractDocument and ModelObject subtypes constrain themselves to operations that would be available on the
# a base Model subtype.  Use the object graph rooted at an AbstractCanvas to reach methods that would only come into
# context through a LocalModel subclass of your common Model type that adds the Local mixin.
#
# What follows is a brief survey of the classes provided here:
#
# Repository -- This class is instantiated once as a singleton within the scope of the RepositoryDomainPackage itself.
# It encapsulates the remote API client and bridges its services to the modeler.  It doubles as a Folder, and
# implements that portion of its interface as Repository's root folder in that capacity.
#
# Folder -- A cache for intermediate grouping nodes form Repsitory URL paths.  No persistent representaiton, but
# facilitates the semantics of move and rename operations.
#
# Project -- Web client domain-level encapsulation of a repository Document at the catalog level.  Projects can be
# found by browsing through Folders or retrieved directly from the Repository by specifying either their logical URI
# or physical UUID in combintion with their domain model ProjectKind value's name.
# representation of a Document.  Opening a Project is how a developer adds Canvases to the Studio.
#
# Studio -- This class is also a singleton and represents client-side's global UI model.  It retains a memento or direct
# reference to the AbstractCanvas artifact for every Document considered open within the UI.  It points at the
# single specific 'Current' Canvas whose interface is currently active within the view.  Canvases that are open, but
# not current may be cached in memory or may have been serialized to local storage and reversibly replaced with a
# Memento Handle.  Dirty/Clean Canvas marking is done here.  An application-scoped event bus is also available.
# A global "current selection" poiner list is available here, but may be augmented by locally scoped selection models
# found in concrete Canvas models and/or their class types.
# TODO: Is there a StudioProvider for route registration?
#
# AbstractCanvas --
#
# Workspace -- A potential refactoring of the "live" elements of Studio to separate them those dealing with
#              book-keeping for inactive document editors (e.g. not the active view)
